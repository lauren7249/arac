<h1>Invitation from New York Life</h1>
<p>Dear {{ agent.first_name }},</p>
<br>
<p>I’m pleased to invite you to complete an analysis of your network as part of our Project 200 initial market development process.  You’ll be asked to connect your accounts using the AdvisorConnect platform to better understand your current network (for example, key information such as occupation and industry information).  Remember that the more accounts you connect, the more valuable this tool will be to your marketing and prospecting efforts.</p>
