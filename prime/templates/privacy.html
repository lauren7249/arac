  <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

  <p>We collect, receive, generate and store the following types of information:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><u>Personal Identifying Information:</u> Personal Identifying Information is information that can be used to identify or contact an individual, including but not limited to one’s name, physical address, email address, birthdate, telephone number, account identifiers, account password, payment information, credit card information and other billing data.  We may collect, receive and store Personal Identifying Information when you sign up or register with the Services or when you fill out forms or questionnaires or complete your profile through the Services or when you otherwise correspond with us or directly provide such information to us.  Furthermore, given that the Services are designed (among other things) to collect, process and analyze your contacts and related information, we may receive, upload and collect Personal Identifying Information of individuals you know or other third parties when you provide such Personal Identifying Information to us, when you authorize us to collect such information from your address books, contact databases, social media accounts or your accounts with other services and applications and/or when we collect such information from available public and third party sources based on the information you have provided to us.  If you decide to upload or import your contacts’ information to the Services, we may request your login credentials for the third party service or application from which you would like us to access such information. Where available and applicable, we may utilize the OAuth standard to facilitate the upload of contact data from such third party services and applications which support the OAuth standard, without requiring your password or other login credentials to do so. Otherwise, we will need your login credentials to complete the upload and import of such contact information.</li>

    <li><u>Personal Non-Identifying Data:</u>  Personal Non-Identifying Data is information about individuals and their characteristics, activities or behavior which cannot be used to identify or contact such individual or which has been stripped of any Personal Identifying Information.  This type of information includes for example, and without limitation, an individual’s gender, city or state of residence, age, industry, financial profile, demographic profile and other non-identifying characteristics.  We collect, receive and store Personal Non-Identifying Data when you directly provide it to us through the Services, when you give us access to such information retained in your computer or accounts or when we collect such information from available public and third party sources.</li>

    <li><u>Information We Collect or Generate About You, Your Contacts and/or the Use of Our Services:</u> We may collect, generate and store certain types of information whenever you use the Services or otherwise interact with us.  For example, we may collect or generate associated information about your individual contacts or other individuals related to your network or we may generate analyses or summaries of such information.  Our Services may analyze all such data and information and generate derivative data or aggregated data as well as reports and other output.  As another example, we may automatically track or record your use of and activity on the Services, the time and date of your activities, your device ID, IP address, browser type, Internet Service Provider, page views, domains, operating system and similar information.  Also, we may automatically send and receive information to and from a computer, mobile phone or other device in connection with the use of the Services.

Finally, we may receive reports and data from third party analytics providers and other third party services, which we may combine with the Personal Identifying Information and other information we collect from you.</li>

  <h2>When is Information Shared with or Disclosed to Others or the Public?</h2>


  <p>Information provided by or collected from our Users is an important part of our business.  Company will share and disclose information submitted, collected, received or generated from and/or about you only as compatible with the purposes described above, when we have permission or consent (as may be provided by you from time to time through the Services or otherwise), or as described in this section as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><u>Disclosures to Employer Users:</u>  If you are a Candidate, we may disclose network summary reports to the User that is interviewing you for employment, which reports may analyze your contacts and networks in an aggregated manner, but will not identify such contacts nor contain or disclose Personal Identifying Information of your contacts and networks to such User.  If you are an employee or contractor of a User – including without limitation a Candidate that is hired by a User – we may disclose to such User, or provide such User with access to, the identities of your contacts and networks and the Personal Identifying Information of your contacts and networks.  Furthermore, we may disclose your own Personal Identifying Information to any User that employs you or is interviewing you as a Candidate.</li>

    <li><u>Aggregated Data and Anonymous Data:</u> Company may publish and otherwise disclose (a) on an aggregated basis, information (including derivative information and analyses) relating to usage and users of the Services and the contact and network information collected through the Services, and (b) information that does not contain Personal Identifying Information or is de-identified and not connected to the name of an individual or entity nor connected to similar information that would allow one to be specifically identified or contacted.</li>

    <li><u>Disclosures In Connection with Permitted Uses:</u>  Company may disclose your information (other than Personal Identifying Information) to third parties in connection with the purposes described in the previous section such as, for example, to commercialize non-identifying information relating to usage and users of the Services or to implement advertising, marketing or promotional activities or transactions.</li>

    <li><u>Company Affiliates:</u> We may share any or all of your information with our subsidiaries and other affiliates, but only if those entities are either subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.</li>

    <li><u>Public Forum:</u> Any User Content or other User information, content or materials submitted, posted, shared, transmitted or otherwise provided to public portions of the Services may be shared with the public without restriction.  Company also reserves the right to publish or make publicly available any information that is already publicly available prior to the time first provided to or collected by Company or information that becomes publicly available without any action or omission on the part of Company.</li>

    <li><u>Contractors, Collaborators and Agents:</u> We may employ other companies, vendors, service providers and individuals to perform functions or services for Company or otherwise act on our behalf. Examples include resolving service problems, hosting websites or software, correcting errors related to the execution of the Services, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance (including data concerning marketing and promotional programs), developing websites and software, providing customer service, assisting Company with providing, administering, developing or improving the Services, and/or for other purposes within the ordinary course of business. These third parties may have access to the Personal Identifying Information and other information needed to perform their functions on our behalf.  We use reasonable efforts to require these companies to (1) provide adequate protections for Personal Identifying Information that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy and (2) use Personal Identifying Information only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by us. We are not liable for the acts or omissions of these third parties, except as provided by applicable law.</li>

    <li><u>Business Transfers and Collaborations:</u> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell the Company and/or its business or assets and/or sell or buy applications websites, services, subsidiaries, or other businesses; or we might collaborate or partner with other companies in strategic transactions, business arrangements or licenses. In such transactions, customer and user information and information regarding usage of the Services (including without limitation Personal Identifying Information and Personal Non-Identifying Data) generally would be one of the transferred business assets or otherwise one of the components of, or involved in, the transaction, we may therefore share this information in connection with such transactions or arrangements.</li>

    <li><u>Compliance with Law and Protection of Company and Others:</u> We reserve the right to disclose Personal Identifying Information and any other information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena or other legal process; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, emergency situations or technical issues; enforce or apply our TOS and other agreements, rights and remedies; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees and contractors, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security and Protection of Your Information</h2>

  <p>The Services may include or interoperate with applications, services, features or functionalities provided by third parties. In connection with such third party applications, services, features or functionalities, you may send (or such third parties may get access to) certain information about or related to you or your activities therewith.  The use, storage and disclosure of such information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and Company has no responsibility or liability for such use, storage and disclosure by such third parties.</p>


  <p>Company is very concerned with safeguarding your information and protecting the security of your Personal Identifying Information and Personal Non-Identifying Data.  We use appropriate, industry-typical security measures and technology to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, user information covered by this Privacy Policy.  In this regard, we employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure and to safeguard such information against loss, theft, alteration and destruction.  No method of security is 100% secure.</p>

  <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on or through the Services in an expedient manner and without unreasonable delay, insofar as these are consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

  <h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>

  <p>Company may provide, but is not obligated to provide, mechanisms for you to directly review, edit or delete portions of your information on or stored through the Services, provided that all such information may be subject to any applicable record retention policies that we may have in place, legal requirements or obligations to employer Users with respect to information from their employees. If you would like us to delete your or your contacts’ Personal Identifying Information in our system, please contact us and we will consider making good faith efforts to accommodate your request, though we have no obligation to do so (and will not do so if we have any legal obligation to retain the record or legitimate business need to retain such information). See below for privacy contact information.  In such cases, we ask individual Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests because of the reasons stated above or because such requests are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, relate to information that is incorporated into other databases or Services as permitted by this Privacy Policy, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes or derivative information that is not separable). Because of the way we maintain certain Services, after information is deleted, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Other Files</h2>


  <p>Like many services, websites or applications, we may use "cookies" or similar technologies to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to a computer's memory for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies or such other technologies to improve the quality of the Services, including for storing user preferences and tracking user trends and for any of the other purposes permitted in this Privacy Policy.  We may utilize persistent cookies to save your registration/member ID and login password for future logins to the Services.  We may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Company users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are usually deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Services.</p>

  <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Services, our servers may record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website or utilize any other services or applications. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other information.  When you use the Services, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) or similar mechanisms which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously.  We may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients and which links are clicked by Users.  In addition, we may employ similar tracking technologies for mobile devices to collect and store information with respect to any mobile application portions of our Services.</p>

  <h2>International Transfer</h2>

  <p>Our Services are hosted in the United States.  If you use the Services from the European Union, Asia or any other country outside the United States with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from the United States laws and regulations, please be advised that through the continued use of the Services, you are transferring information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.  Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us or use the Services, Company transfers personal information to the United States and processes it there, and your submission of such information represents your consent and agreement to that transfer.

  <h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

  <p>California law permits residents of California to request certain details about what personal information a company shares with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not share your Personal Identifying Information with third parties for the third parties’ own and independent direct marketing purposes unless we receive your permission.</p>

  <h2>Our Policy Toward Children</h2>

  <p>In order to use our Services you must represent and warrant that you are over the age of 18 in the sign-up process.  Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to use the Services and must not attempt to sign-up with the Services and/or submit any personal information to us.   We do not knowingly collect personal information from any person who is under the age of 18 or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 18, we will delete this information as quickly as possible.</p> 

  <h2>Links to Other Services and Applications</h2>

  <p>Our Services may contain links to, interoperate with, and allow you to share content to and from third party services, websites and applications. The fact that we link to a website, service or application or allow you to share content through these third parties is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. Other websites, services and applications follow different rules regarding the collection, use, storage or disclosure of the personal and other information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites, services and applications you use.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <p>Even though Company has taken reasonable commercial steps and efforts to prevent Personal Identifying Information and other information covered by this Privacy Policy from being accessed, used, intercepted or disclosed by unauthorized individuals in violation of this Privacy Policy, you should know and you acknowledge that Company cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with your information.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that uploading, posting, providing, storing, using, analyzing, transmitting, sharing and/or allowing access to Personal Identifying Information and other information on, through, in or to the Services, and the use of all such Services, are all done at your sole risk and responsibility.   You expressly acknowledge that Company is not liable for (i) any special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive damages, costs, or liabilities whatsoever arising out of or resulting from your use of the Services, including from uploading, posting, providing, storing, using, analyzing, transmitting, sharing and/or allowing access to Personal Identifying Information and other information; or (ii) any loss, disclosure or use of your Personal Identifying Information or other information.</p>
